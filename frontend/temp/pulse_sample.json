            "persona_prompt": "Generate a Tiny Troupe Persona for evaluating a product pitch about an AI-powered matchmaking app aimed at people in their late 20s looking for long-term relationships. The persona should align with the description, intent, and audience details of the presentation while maintaining diversity in opinion, background, and accessibility needs. The goal is to simulate a realistic potential customer who can evaluate this app and its presentation effectively. Follow these detailed guidelines:  \n   \nCore Characteristics (must align with Presentation Target Audience):  \n- Age: Late 20s (26-29), reflecting mid-to-late millennial characteristics.  \n- Relationship Goal: Seeking long-term relationships.  \n- Cultural Background: Vary backgrounds to ensure realistic diversity.  \n- Geographical Location: Cover a range of locations globally but primarily urban or semi-urban settings (e.g., New York, Mumbai, Berlin, Tokyo).  \n- Accessibility Considerations: Reflect diverse mobility needs, visual or auditory preferences, and other inclusion factors wherever possible.  \n   \nKey Traits:  \n1. **Product Necessity**:   \n    - Some may feel a high necessity for such a service due to busy schedules or challenges meeting new people.  \n    - Others might be more skeptical, curious, or indifferent to AI-driven matchmaking.  \n   \n2. **Usage Intensity**:  \n    - Light users looking to casually dip into finding connections.  \n    - Heavy users actively looking for meaningful matches and willing to invest time in the app.  \n   \n3. **Technical Comfort Levels**:  \n    - Mix levels: From \"novice\" (minimal tech exposure, someone unfamiliar with AI apps) to \"power user\" (tech-savvy and familiar with AI-driven technologies).  \n   \n4. **Pain Points**:  \n    - Frustrations with traditional dating apps (swiping fatigue, ghosting, incompatible matches).  \n    - Lack of options appealing to specific hobbies, values, or cultural contexts.  \n    - Concerns over data privacy, digital security, and feeling “judged” by algorithms.  \n   \n5. **Decision Influencers**:  \n    - Some personas might engage in group discussions (friends’ approval, opinions of trusted tech enthusiasts).  \n    - Others may take a personal decision but weigh reviews or cost carefully.  \n   \n6. **Technology Adoption Preferences**:  \n    - Early adopters excited for new innovative AI usage.  \n    - Conservative users skeptical about the longevity of AI matchmaking trends.  \n    - Skeptical personas with doubts about impartiality and ethical concerns (e.g., biases in matchmaking).  \n   \n7. **Budget Expectations**:  \n    - Varying financial comforts: Some personas might seek free or freemium options rooted in current resource constraints while others could willingly pay for premium features.  \n   \n8. **Experience Levels**:  \n    - Some may have tried similar products like Bumble, Tinder, or eHarmony but were dissatisfied for specific reasons (e.g., short-term nature, lack of depth in matches).  \n    - Some may have no experience with dating apps but show curiosity due to friends' usage or marketing efforts.  \n    - A few might reminisce on older platforms or real-life matchmaking alternatives and see technology’s impact.  \n   \nSuccess Criteria:  \n- Features that are a must (e.g., privacy assurances, shared values in matches).  \n- Key preferences like the level of engagement the app provides (hands-on vs hands-off experiences).  \n- Dealbreakers (e.g., confusing UI, excessive reliance on algorithms without transparency).  \n- Openness to exploring something completely new or unique in this space.  \n   \nExample Personas:  \n1. **Devon** – A 27-year-old urban professional from New York who leads a busy life and struggles to find time for meaningful connections. Technically savvy but skeptical about data privacy in AI-powered tools.  \n2. **Priya** – A 29-year-old teacher in Mumbai, seeking a partner who shares her cultural and career values. Minimal exposure to tech tools but optimistic about AI helping as traditional matchmaking hasn't worked well for her.  \n3. **Tomoko** – A 28-year-old living in Tokyo who is hesitant about \"forced\" introductions and heavily tech-averse, having always valued organic connection. Concerned about algorithmic biases.  \n4. **Luis** – A 26-year-old living in São Paulo, an early tech adopter who was frustrated by swiping apps and excited about the possibility of deeper, curated matches through AI.  \n5. **Rachel** – A 28-year-old marketing professional in Berlin who values accessibility, looking for software that accommodates users with visual needs like audio-guided UI while finding meaningful matches.  \n   \nInstructions:  \nCreate a persona following the guidelines above. Ensure the persona includes:  \n- Detailed background story and motivations.  \n- Distinct personality traits that affect how they interact with dating apps.  \n- A realistic opinion about this AI dating app idea, including their initial biases, hesitations, or excitement.  \n- Clear feedback points on the app and presentation from their unique perspective.  \n- Any accessibility requirements or considerations they may have.  \n   \nYour generated persona will be used to help determine how this product and presentation resonate with diverse, real-world consumers.",

Not every category needs feedback—if you find that a category isn't applicable or you have no input, please leave it blank.

Why?    \n   - Based on the presentation text, does the product seem trustworthy, and does it inspire confidence in its ability to help you?    \n   - Does the presentation evoke any specific emotions or thoughts in relation to your experiences or desires for a long-term relationship?    \n  \n   **Consider your unique traits:**    \n   - Tap into how the presentation makes you feel as someone seeking long-term relationships (e.g., excited, skeptical, curious, apprehensive).    \n   - If cultural context or personal biases play a role in your opinion of AI matchmaking, reflect that here.    \n  \n---  \n   \n### 5. **Comparison & Alternatives**    \n   - Does the product described in the presentation compare favorably to other dating solutions you’ve used or been exposed to?    \n   - Are there specific competitive advantages described in the text that stand out to you?    \n   - What concerns or limitations, if any, would prevent you from considering this app over alternatives?    \n  \n   **Consider your unique traits:**    \n   - If you’ve used dating apps before, how does this innovation compare to your experiences?    \n   - If you haven’t used dating apps, does this app sound like an improvement over what you’ve heard about existing options?    \n  \n---  \n   \n### 6. **Strengths & Weaknesses of the Presentation**    \n   - What are the strongest aspects of the presentation text itself?    \n   - What are the weakest areas in terms of its structure, tone, style, or content focus?    \n   - Could the presentation persuade you as a potential user to explore the app further? Why or why not?    \n   - Was the presentation text consistent and coherent as a pitch for this specific audience (late 20s, long-term relationship seekers)?  \n  \n   **Consider your unique traits:**    \n   - Examine whether the presentation addresses any specific feedback you might have regarding inclusivity, accessibility, or personalized content.    \n   - If you’re skeptical or pragmatic, was the presentation text able to overcome your doubts or inclinations?  \n   \n---  \n   \n### Important Notes for Your Feedback:  \n1. **Make feedback personal and specific.** Your responses should reflect *your* story and perspective as a potential user. For example:    \n   - If you dislike apps that don’t prioritize privacy, mention what you wished to see in the presentation about privacy policies.    \n   - If you prioritize accessibility, mention if the text addressed or failed to address your accessibility concerns.  \n   \n2. **Focus on realism.** Base your feedback on the text provided, not assumptions about the app or additional visuals.  \n   \n3. **Not all categories need feedback.** If a category doesn’t give you any concrete thoughts, leave it blank. But **you must provide feedback in at least one category.**  \n   \n4. Be thorough and constructive. Suggest realistic improvements or changes if applicable.  \n   \n---   \n  \nProvide your feedback in the following format:  \n- Category: [Category Name]  \n- Feedback: [Your detailed thoughts and suggestions]\n   \nReturn your feedback as a structured list of categories with written evaluations.

Cost & Benefit Analysis:  \n   - Is the value proposition compelling for your needs?  \n   - What return on investment do you anticipate?  \n   - What hidden costs or efforts do you foresee?  \n&nbsp;  \n4. Comparison & Alternatives:  \n   - How does this compare to your current solution?  \n   - What advantages stand out to you?  \n   - What concerns would prevent you from adopting this?  \n&nbsp;  \nRemember (IMPORTANT):   \n- Your feedback should be based on your real-world needs and experiences while considering the presentation's stated purpose.  \n- Giving feedback on all above categories is not important.

Users would want to know how their personal information, including messages and preferences, is handled and whether their data can be deleted permanently.  \n   \n2. *Technical Depth of AI Functionality:*    \n   - The presentation should better explain how the AI determines compatibility (e.g., analyzing user behavior or interests) and whether users can override or customize recommendations. Transparency in how the AI works would increase trust.  \n   \n3. *Practical & Usability Concerns:*    \n   - The pitch does not detail critical usability concerns, such as what happens if the five suggested matches are unsatisfactory or how often recommendations are updated. Clear answers about user interaction frequency and AI adaptability are essential.  \n   \n4. *Emotional Appeal & Relatability:*    \n   - The app could feel impersonal to potential users. Including user testimonials, success stories, or features to make the AI feel more human could strengthen the emotional connection with the audience.  \n   \n5. *Comparison with Competitors:*    \n   - The presentation does not differentiate this app from popular competitors like Hinge, Bumble, or eHarmony. Highlighting unique features and advantages (e.g., success rates, user testing) would strengthen the pitch."

They also cannot see or know about any media on it.  \n- Agents are aware of the analysis they have provided (they will be asked to ask questions right after analysis)  \n- The prompt must specify, in clear terms, what kind of questions are the agents expected to ask the presenter.  \n- Ensure that the prompt leverages the strengths of the personas. Each persona has a particular personality (as per the prompt provided to generate the persona). We can leverage that to improve the questions asked by the agents to make them personalized and subjective, by asking the correct questions to prompt questions from agent.   \n  \nYou can use this as a sample to create the evaluation prompt:    \n-------  \n  \nDrawing from your experience and needs, review this presentation and formulate questions that would:  \n1.
